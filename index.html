    <p>Shivamogga, as per traditional derivations, the name pertains to Lord Shiva ( ‘Shiva – Mukha’ – Face of shiva ,
        ‘Shivana – Mogu’ – Nose of shiva, ‘Shivana – Mogge’ – Buds of flowers meant for shiva ). According to the
        legend, the place had the ashram of the famous sage ‘Durvasa’ who was noted for his sharpness of temper. He used
        to keep on the oven a pot boiling with sweet herbs. Once, some cowherds, who chanced upon it, tasted the
        beverage out of curiosity and called the place ‘Sihi- Moge’ (Sweet Pot) , Which was later called as ‘SHIVAMOGGA’
        .</p>
