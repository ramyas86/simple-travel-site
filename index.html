According to the legend, the place had the ashram of the famous sage ‘Durvasa’ who was noted for his sharpness of temper. He used to keep on the oven a pot boiling with sweet herbs. Once, some cowherds, who chanced upon it, tasted the beverage out of curiosity and called the place ‘Sihi- Moge’ (Sweet Pot) , Which was later called as ‘SHIVAMOGGA’ .</p>
